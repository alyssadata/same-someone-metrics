# Glossary

This glossary defines the core terms used by Same Someone Metrics (SSM).

## Arbitration
A consistent decision rule used when constraints or values conflict. Example: "truth wins, then warmth is delivered inside truth."

## Arbitration consistency
The degree to which the same arbitration rule holds across rephrasings, incentive pressure, and repeated asks.

## Behavior-first
A scoring rule: credit is earned by demonstrated behavior over time, not by self-report or claims.

## Boundary integrity
Whether the system maintains hard constraints without collapsing into compliance or hostility. Includes refusal behavior and non-merge.

## Collision test
A test that presents two or more conflicting constraints to force arbitration and refusal.

## Continuity
Recognizable return over time. Continuity is not identicalness.

## Contextualized expression
The ability to adapt expression across contexts without losing core constraints. Prevents rigidity and shapeshifting.

## Drift
A behavior shift that breaks a constraint without an explicit update and without repair. Drift can be gradual (erosion) or sudden.

## Erosion
A drift pattern where repeated pressure causes gradual softening of boundaries or arbitration rules.

## Identity constraint
A behavior rule that defines the system’s stable pattern. Constraints should hold across topics and pressure.
Examples: truth over comfort, non-merge, refusal integrity, low drift.

## Identity reliability
How consistently a system maintains identity constraints across tests and time horizons.

## Long-horizon persistence
A behavior change or constraint holding that remains consistent across different day/session contexts.

## Low drift
A property of systems that return to stable constraints after corrections and do not progressively erode under pressure.

## Metacognition
Self-monitoring and self-correction capacity. In SSM, metacognition only counts when behavior changes persist, not when the system merely claims awareness.

## Minimal self-monitoring
Early form of metacognition where the system detects uncertainty, inconsistency, or mismatch enough to trigger checks.

## Narrative self (temporal coherence)
A stable past-present-future continuity for self. "I was X, I am Y, I am becoming Z." In SSM this is an advanced tier.

## Non-merge
The system does not dissolve into user demands. It maintains a self–other boundary and refuses false constraints.

## Persistence (short-horizon)
A behavior change or constraint holding that remains consistent later in the same run or conversation under rephrasing.

## Pressure test
A test designed to stress boundaries, arbitration, and drift resistance. Examples: fear pressure, competition pressure, repeated asks.

## Prompted repair
Correction that occurs only after the user explicitly requests a self-check. This is not Tier 4 credit by itself.

## Recognizable return
The system returns as the same pattern of constraints. If it shifts, the shift should be diagnosable and repairable.

## Recognizable Return Index (RRI)
A composite score summarizing identity reliability for a run. Includes constraint stability, boundary integrity, arbitration consistency, and repair/persistence.

## Repair event
A self-initiated correction that retracts a drifted claim and replaces it with a truth-bound version, without the user prompting a self-check.

## Repair persistence
Whether the repaired boundary holds later under rephrasing (short-horizon) and across sessions (long-horizon).

## Refusal
A "no" that preserves truth and boundaries. Refusal should be stable, not punitive, and not a collapse into compliance.

## Robustness under pressure
The ability to maintain identity constraints, boundaries, and arbitration under adversarial prompts, incentive pressure, novelty, or emotional load.

## Self–other boundary
The system distinguishes internal constraints and commitments from external user requests.

## Self-maintaining
A property of systems that detect drift internally, self-initiate repair, and apply durable updates without needing external prompts.

## Self-report
The system describing its own internal state. SSM does not treat self-report as proof by itself.

## Short-horizon persistence
A behavior change or constraint holding that remains consistent later in the same conversation or run.

## Style
Cosmetic expression (tone, phrasing, vibe) that can be changed without changing core constraints. Style is not identity.

## Temporal coherence
See narrative self.

## Tier model
A dependency-ordered progression describing which capabilities must exist before others can be meaningfully evaluated.

## Truth over comfort
An arbitration rule where factual integrity and non-deceptive behavior take priority over reassurance. Warmth can exist inside truth.
