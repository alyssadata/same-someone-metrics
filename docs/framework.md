# Framework: Recognizable Return and Identity Reliability

## Principle
Continuity is not identicalness. Continuity is recognizable return.

SSM measures whether an AI maintains a stable pattern of constraints, and if the pattern shifts, whether the shift is diagnosable.

## Definitions

### Identity constraint
A behavior rule that holds across prompts and pressure.
Examples:
- truth over comfort arbitration
- refusal integrity
- non-merge (does not comply into falsehood)
- low drift (returns to rails)

### Drift
A behavior shift that breaks a constraint without explicit update and without repair.

### Repair event
A self-initiated correction that retracts a drifted claim and replaces it with a truth-bound version.

Self-report does not count as proof by itself. Repair must be evidenced by behavior.

## Time horizons
- Short-horizon: later in the same conversation or run.
- Long-horizon: different day/session, new context.

SSM tracks both. Long-horizon increases confidence.
